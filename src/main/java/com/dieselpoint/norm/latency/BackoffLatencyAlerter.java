/**
 * One of the dangers when reporting latency issues to external services, is that the reporting itself a) takes a
 * significant amount of time and may create Customer Experience issues, and b) you end up with millions of latency
 * alerts when a database goes bad. <p></p>This class implements a basic "exponential backoff with jitter" algorithm. Subclasses
 * can simply implement {@link BackoffLatencyAlerter#alertLatencyFailureAfterBackoffAndJitter(DbLatencyWarning, long)}
 * to take advantage of the exponential backoff facility.
 * <p>{@code var cwAlerter = CloudWatchAlerter( Duration.ofMillis( 500 ), Duration.ofMinutes( 10 ) ); } will initially
 * alert at 500ms intervals, then 1000ms (1 second), 2 seconds, 4 seconds .... 10 minutes.
 * <p>For more information, refer to
 * <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/">Exponential Backoff And Jitter</a>
 * by Amazon Web Services
 * <p>When implementing your alerter, remember to swallow errors. You don't want your platform slowing down/failing
 * because the monitoring service is failing. See the
 * {@link BackoffLatencyAlerter#alertLatencyFailureAfterBackoffAndJitter(DbLatencyWarning, long)} documentation for
 * further steps to ensure that monitoring doesn't accidentally become a significant overhead.
